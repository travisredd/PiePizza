Not sure why but my bootstrap and css work in my local IIS server however when deployed to Azure it doesn't work. 

I don't know if I did this correctly I probably needed to use the POST()/GET() method? It works though without the controller so I am pretty happy. 

I did switch in the _Layout the css and bootstrap style tags becauuse the css wasn't working when the boostrap was on bottom. I am pretty sure CSS is supposed to be above bootstrap in the head though.
